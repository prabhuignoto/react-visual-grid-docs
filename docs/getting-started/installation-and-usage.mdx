## Installation & Usage

This section provides instructions on how to install and use the `react-visual-grid` package. The package can be installed using `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`. Here are the commands for installation:

```bash
npm install --save react-visual-grid
```

```bash
yarn add react-visual-grid
```

```bash
pnpm add react-visual-grid
```

## Building a Simple Grid

Let's start by creating a simple image grid that contains 30 images. To generate the grid, we will use the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) service, which produces random images. Here is an example code snippet in `App.js`:

```jsx title="App.js"
import { Grid } from "react-visual-grid";
import "react-visual-grid/dist/react-visual-grid.css";

const images = Array.from({ length: 30 }, (_, index) => ({
  src: `https://picsum.photos/id/${index+1})}/800/600`,
  alt: `Image ${i + 1}`
}));

return (
  <div>
    <Grid
      images={images}
      width={800}
      height={600}
    />
  </div>
);
```
:::info
Please note that the `Grid` component uses the `VERTICAL` layout as the default rendering mode. You can change this by passing the [gridLayout](../props.md#gridlayout) prop to the `Grid` component. Additionally, it is mandatory to pass the `width` and `height` props to the `Grid`, as the library uses these values to render the optimal number of thumbnails.

## Images Array

As shown in the example above, the images are passed to the `Grid` component as an array. Each image object in the array comes with a set of properties:

| Name    | Description                      | Type     | Default |
| :------ | :------------------------------- | :------- | :------ |
| src     | URL of the image                 | string   |         |
| alt     | Alt text for the image           | string   |         |
| width   | Width of the image               | number   | 100     |
| height  | Height of the image              | number   | 100     |
| id      | Unique ID of the image           | string   |         |
| onClick | Callback to be executed on click | Function |         |

:::info
Please note that only the `src` and `alt` properties are mandatory, as the rest of the properties are used for internal purposes and can be safely ignored.
